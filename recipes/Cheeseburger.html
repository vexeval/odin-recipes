			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul class="ingredients">
				<li>1 pound ground beef (80 percent lean)</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
				<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons salted butter</li>
				<li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
				<li>3 slices sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
				<li>3 rolls brioche, split and toasted</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Place ground beef in a bowl and season with Worcestershire sauce,
					salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly and shape into 3 balls. Set aside.
				</li>
				<li>
					Melt butter in a large skillet. Add onion and cook until onions start
					to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the skillet. Add 3 ground beef
					balls to the same skillet and flatten with a cast iron press or a
					heavy spatula. Evenly top each patty with onions and cook for 3 to 4
					minutes more.

				<li>
					Carefully flip patties over so that the onions are now on the bottom,
					pressing once again with cast iron press or heavy spatula. Top each
					with a slice of cheese and cook until cheese is melted and burgers
					have reached the desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve on brioche
					buns.
